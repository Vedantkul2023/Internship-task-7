I first create a database view, a fundamental concept that simplifies complex queries and enhances security.
I wrote a CREATE VIEW statement to define a new view called customer_order_summary. This view was designed to abstract the complexity of joining multiple tables and performing aggregations. The underlying query for the view:
Joined the Customers and Orders tables on customer_id.
Grouped the results by each customer.
Aggregated the data to calculate each customer's total number of orders (COUNT) and total spending (SUM).
After defining the view, I showed how to use it just like a regular table.
I wrote a simple SELECT * query to show all the data from the new customer_order_summary view.
I also demonstrated how to apply a WHERE clause and an ORDER BY clause to the view, showcasing that you can filter and sort its data just like any other table.
